# Ampera-inverter-driver-interface
This is a simple board to interface with Ampera inverter. It has driver pins and current sensor contacts. I also put aside one temp sensor. On the left side there is also isolated voltage sensing interface designed for Johannes Huebner inverter.

Ver 2.3 Board is a little larger and it incorporates both connectors which are used for driver and sensor board on Rev2 controler. I recommend this board if you decide to go that route.
Additionally i included the inverter chip connected to BOTH driver connectors sou you can drive both IGBT bridges if you want to experiment.
